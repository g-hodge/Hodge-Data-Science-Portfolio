# TidyData-Project
## Summary 🐧
In this project, I create a simple Streamlit app. Through the app, users have the opportunity to engage with a dataset containing information on penguins that live near Palmer Station in Antarctica. 

## Data 📊
This project's data comes from a modified version of **Kristen Gorman, Tony Williams, and William Fraser's** ["Ecological Sexual Dimorphism and Environmental Variability within a Community of Antarctic Penguins (Genus *Pygoscelis*)"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0090081).

The dataset contains nine variables:


``bill_depth_mm``: The depth of penguins' bills measured in millimeters.

``bill_length_mm``: The length of penguins' bills measured in millimeters.

``body_mass_g``: The mass of penguins measured in grams.

``flipper_length_mm``: The length of penguins' flippers measured in millimeters.

``id``: A unique identifier for each penguin.

``island``: The island the penguins lives on (possibilities: Biscoe, Dream, Torgersen)

``species``: The penguins' species (possibilities: Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)

``sex``: The penguins' sex (possibilities: female, male)

``year``: The year the data was recorded (possibilities: 2007, 2008, 2009)

## Code Instructions 🖥️

Please import these libraries*:

``pandas`` for data wrangling

``streamlit`` for interactive app development

*If you are having issues, try to run the command ``!pip install`` with the desired library.

## App Instructions 📱

To access the app in ``main.py``...

1) Open your terminal
2) Enter ``streamlit run main.py``*
3) Engage with the app!

*It may be necessary to run ``cd`` followed by the folder ``main.py`` is in on your computer.
